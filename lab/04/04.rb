# The dog class must have a give method that takes a bone object and adds it to an array of bones for the dog. The dog can take a maximum of three bones so if you give it more than three it will will print, I have too many bones.

# The dog class must have an eat bone method so that when you call it it removes a bone from the array of bones and prints "yummy! I ate 'big' bone" the 'big' part comes from the size attribute of bone.
